                            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                            <p>The why of Washee. We love our greens. Sure, there are cool vape pens available
                                but nothing has ever truly replaced smoking buds for us. With legalization, the
                                quality of our greens could not be better. And that's what it's really about for us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are a team of tinkerers at heart. When we first conceived Washee, we didn't have
                                a particular technology in mind. Like other smokers, we had to deal with the tar
                                and resins that accumulate in our pipes. As the pipe gets dirtier, you start wasting
                                greens as the airflow in your pipe constraints and the flavor of your greens gets
                                tainted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chemical cleaners for pipes suck. You're telling me I have to get my hands
                                dirty to clean them? Really, that's the best you can do?
                                We knew deep in our hearts there was an easier
                                and convenient way to get pipes clean. After all, cannabis is no longer a taboo. It's
                                an important and large market.
                            </p>
                            <p>That's what it's all about for us. We don't see ourselves as a company that makes pipes
                                cleaners.
                                We see ourselves as a company dedicated to help you make the most out of your greens
                                and
                                enjoy them to their fullest.
                            </p>

                                Early adopters are the people who start using or product
                                before anyone else. Early adopters are arguably the
                                spark of innovation. They are the first backers in any
                                new trend.

                                However, the success of a product goes beyond its technical capabilities.
                                It also involves a great product presentation, HD photos, great video
                                commercials,
                                web presence and promotion to fully bring to life and that's exactly
                                what this campaign is for.

                                We've developed the product and source manufacturing. Now, we
                                need your help to get to the next level. To get Washee out there.
                                This campaign is a prelude to an upcoming Indiegogo campaign. However,
                                unlike campaigns hosted on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, this campaign
                                is constraint by number of units that we will sell rather than time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The units on this campaign are reserved for our early adopters
                                and contain special rewards and discounts. No more units will be sold
                                when the campaign is 100% fulfilled.
                            </p>
                            <p> Most startups sell their first version
                                units to their most important contributors, early adopters,
                                and then forget about them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We want to be different. The rewards on this campaign
                                are meant to turn the highest risk Early Adopters get
                                into a unique gift we wont give away to others.

                                This campaign is limited to <span class="numberSelling"></span> units.
                                From the money raised, the COG (cost of good) is saved from every order
                                along with shipping charges. This means that the portion of the Funds
                                raised from this campaign needed to fulfill the orders is retained
                                (and then some). This means the Early adopter units are guaranteed
                                separately from the Indiegogo campaign and they also ship first.

                            <p>The production of units for this campaign will be part of the production
                                as the units we will sell on the Indiegogo campaign. We do this to
                                take advantage of economies of scale. However, the Early Adopter orders
                                will be fulfilled first.

                                The biggest challenge a physical product has from a crowdfund perspective lies
                                with parts that require heavy tooling. This is a consideration we had from the
                                beginning when we started development. We were more interested in designing
                                something that we could fulfill at variable quantities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We purposely stayed away
                                from tooling at the cost of somewhat higher cost per part and some aesthetics.
                                However, this helps us ensure we can deliver a quality product that takes into
                                account any campaign outcome. This puts us in a comfortable position from a
                                production stand-point. Learn more about our engineering background

                            <p>Washee is the world's first bong and pipe cleaning machine for the home.
                                Washee cleans your bongs and pipes using nothing but water.
                                Say goodbye to bottle cleaners, ziploc bags, and getting your hands dirty.
                                Most bongs and pipes get cleaned in 20 minutes (Check out our <a href="#Performance">
                                    performance section</a>)
                            </p>
                            <p>Washee uses a combination of heat and mechanical action to leave
                                your bongs and pipes like the day you bought them. It's harmless
                                on your pieces and also disinfects them. </p>

                                <p>The cleaning effect per given volume is similar across all 3 Washee units.
                                    The difference between the units lies in the size of the cleaning volume.
                                    The wattage is increased accordingly in each one to have to maintain the
                                    cleaning effect/volume ratio. This means that the guidelines provided here
                                    apply to all the units.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The cleaning effect is also uniformly distributed across the cleaning tank.
                                    This is not true exactly but it is not a large enough gradient to make it
                                    noticeable.
                                    This means that you can clean several pieces simultaneously on the larger units.
                                    This is particularly relevant for the commercial unit where you may want to
                                    maximize both time and money by cleaning as many pieces as once as possible.
                                    However, if you purchased the Bong sized unit, you could instead clean several
                                    smaller pieces if you wished to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the main cleaning characteristics you would want to know
                                    is the cleaning time given a determined amount of usage of your pipe or bong.
                                    Washee has an exponential curve representing its cleaning cycle duration as a
                                    function of bong/pipe usage.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    All of this translate to Washee being better the more often you use it.
                                    There are several <a href="#reasons">reasons why you want to clean your pieces
                                        more often than not.</a>
                                </p>

                                    The geometry of bongs and pipes is a very diverse one. From the incredibly artistic
                                    to
                                    the purely functional, bongs and pipes come in all kinds of shapes. For this
                                    reason,
                                    it is impractical to give exact formulas for cleaning times given a specific usage.
                                    However, expect your pieces to fall within <a>the recommended usage</a> at worst
                                    (meaning that your pipe could even go longer without cleaning - <a href="#reasons">not
                                        that
                                        you would want to do that</a>).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Washee's cleaning effect is tied to the surface area of water in contact with the
                                    tars and
                                    resins that need to be removed. This means that its performance will be best on
                                    pieces with large cavities (such as bongs) and it will have lower performance
                                    on tight passage ways inside the pipe (this is specially true of artistic pipes).
                                    If you are cleaning pieces that have long and very narrow passageways, stick to the
                                    guideline
                                    of cleaning the piece regularly; specially if it is used often.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                                <p>
                                    As the cleaning frequency of your piece is reduced, the cleaning time
                                    grows exponentially. If a pipe has been used over an extended period of time
                                    without cleaning, Washee may run into a situation where it will either need
                                    a large amount of time to clean the pipe (in terms of hours) or in a different
                                    case,
                                    it will be unable to remove resin deposits that form inside.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you have a piece that hasn't been cleaned in months, and you try to clean it
                                    with
                                    Washee, it may take several hours or cycles to do so. However, in some cases, large
                                    resin
                                    and tar deposits are formed inside that are not able to escape or dissolve in the
                                    water.
                                    This is particularly true of pipes with narrow cavities.
                                </p>
                                <p>It is worthy to note that this is
                                    not a problem particular to Washee. All pipe cleaners have this same issue. Perhaps
                                    you've tried using a bottle cleaner before only to find resin rocks forming inside
                                    which you have to poke and break. This same phenomena can occur with Washee if a
                                    piece has not been cleaned
                                    in a long time. Albeit, Washee
                                    has this problem much less than other cleaners because of the way it removes the
                                    resin.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Why does this happen at all? Resin is the like of substance that likes to stick to
                                    itself.
                                    As you remove it from the glass, it finds other particles similar to itself. If you
                                    haven't
                                    cleaned your piece in a long time, there will be enough resin to attract to itself
                                    faster than it can dissolve in the medium. It is worthy to note, however, that you
                                    will not
                                    encounter this issue if Washee is used as recommended.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Recommended Usage</h2>
                                <p>We've covered Washee's performance and limitations. I hope we gave you a
                                    good overview of Washee's effectiveness which is better when used regularly.
                                    However, performance aside, there are other reasons why it is best
                                    to clean bongs and pipes regularly:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bacteria and mold thrive on a dirty pipe and you get exposed to it if you don't
                                        clean
                                        your pipe or bong.

                                    <li>
                                        You start wasting precious greens. As we mentioned, the components in the tars
                                        and resins
                                        attract each other. The more tar and resins you have inside your pipe, the more
                                        of the
                                        psychoactive
                                        components of cannabis keep getting stuck to it, which means your smoke has
                                        less.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        You waste even more precious greens. The accumulated tar and resins constrain
                                        airflow which greatly
                                        reduces the combustion efficiency of your pipe.

                                    <li>
                                        The more frequently you clean your pipe, the shorter the cleaning cycles are.
                                        This means you
                                        spend less on electricity.

                                <p>
                                    Washee is designed so that you clean your piece
                                    after smoking 1/4 oz through it between 20 to 30 min. This is about
                                    every week or biweekly for many daily users. It's hard to come up with
                                    exact formulas for cleaning time because geometries vary so wildly among pieces
                                    but expect this range at its worst.
                                </p>

                                    To give you a more tangible idea, a normal size spoon pipe with 1/4 oz
                                    smoked through it will require a 20 min cleaning cycle.
                                    Pipes with wide cavities can wait even longer for a
                                    similar cleaning time although we don't recommend it.

                            <p>
                                It was late fall in Michigan 2016. I was working at a innovation company and we
                                were amidst fulfilling a new product. Those are usually busy times, so when I got home
                                that day, I was ready to relax and smoke. I packed my bowl and tried to light it up.
                                I couldn't get a decent hit out. (Both) my pipes were heavily clogged.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was out of cleaner, so I had to go get some. "Are you s@itting me." That's
                                the last thing you want to do coming home from work. I reluctancy drove to the
                                store, bought some cleaners, put my pipes in ziploc bags and started shaking it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While I was doing that, I started video chatting with my long time friend from
                                engineering
                                school Mario Rodriguez. We had been planning to branch off our jobs and create
                                something
                                by ourselves. We had ideas on the drawing board, but during that conversation, I
                                was explaining my pain to Mario getting the cleaners and said "there has to be a better
                                way."
                                Light bulbs turned on. That was the beginning of Washee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We knew we wanted it to
                                be 100% water based because what could be cooler than that?
                                2 years later and we've experimented and tested every conceivable way
                                possible in which you could clean a pipe using water. We have a understanding
                                of the methods for achieving this outcome in a friendly and energy efficient product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, we've done all the engineering and sourcing. We are ready to
                                take Washee out on the market and we hope you can be a part of this new story with us.

                                    only the section of the pieces that are in contact with water
                                    will get cleaned.

                                <h2>What is different between this campaign and the upcoming Indiegogo?</h2>
                                <p>There are 2 differences: the perks and the campaign metrics.
                                    The perks differ in that the 2x1 voucher and the discounts from this campaign are
                                    unique to this campaign
                                    only. The Indiegogo campaign will no have the 2x1 voucher and the discounts wont be
                                    as large.
                                    They are also different in the metrics. While the Indiegogo campaign is limited by
                                    time (1 month),
                                    this campaign is instead limited by the amount of units being sold.</p>
                                <h2>Why are you throwing a crowdfund campaign on your site before launching
                                    an Indiegogo campaign?</h2>
                                <p>Contrary to popular belief, running a crowdfund campaign is not without costs (and
                                    it's also not cheap). From having presentable prototypes to HD videos and photos,
                                    going to
                                    events, etc, the costs can be significant. In addition, we are a group of engineers
                                    and
                                    there are areas (such as marketing) in which we need help.
                                    Running this campaign will provide us with the
                                    resources to promote the product adequately. The success of a product goes beyond
                                    engineering.
                                    Presentation and
                                    proper marketing play an important role in seeing a brand succeed. The funds from
                                    this campaign
                                    will provide us with that. We thought the best way to do it would be to give
                                    special perks to our
                                    Early Adopters.
                                    <h2>Can I exchange my 2x1 voucher for a current version?</h2>
                                    <p>Yes, you can exchange your 2x1 future voucher for a current version. Please get

                                    <h2>I want to purchase the commercial unit and offer a
                                        cleaning service. How can I charge?
                                    </h2>
                                    <p>Here we provide 2 approaches you can take.
                                        You can either charge your customers a monthly fee and clean any pieces they
                                        bring in or
                                        you can charge per cleaning cycle. You can wash as many pieces as you can fit
                                        inside Washee
                                        (ensuring there is no air trapped inside). The most economic approach will be
                                        to collect
                                        pieces that will be cleaned and try to make them in a single batch (or as many
                                        needed). Consumers
                                        can pick them up the next day or so which brings them back to your store.
                                        Running the commercial unit for 1 hour will spend less than $0.10 in electric
                                        cost (US average).
                                        Charging a couple of bucks for spoon pipes and similar sizes and more for bongs
                                        and such will
                                        be profitable.
